# Flippr

![alt text][logo]

A small [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) component for easily implementing flipping tiles


## Motivation
I just needed some nice-looking entry points for my website. Just putting links on the navbar was not enough. 
Several iterations of discussion with my colleagues later, we came up with tiles, which flip, while hovering over them.
